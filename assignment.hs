-- This assignment asks you to write a number of Haskell functions.
--
-- I'd prefer you to use the
--
--    myfunc a b = ...
--
-- form rather than 
--
--    myfunc = \a b -> ...
--
-- Submit this via a PR when you're done.

-- Write a function `reciprocal` that takes a single parameter and
-- returns the reciprocal of that number. This should make (1a) and (1b) 
-- correct in the main function at the end

reciprocal x = 1/x


-------
-- 2 --
-------

-- Write a function square that squares a number. Uncomment (2) below
-- and check it works.

square x = x*x

-------
-- 3 --
-------

-- Use the two previous functions to write a new function, `oneOverXSquared`,
-- that returns the reciprocal of the square of its parameter
-- (that is, 1 / x²). Make sure (3) works.

oneOverXSquared x = reciprocal (square x)

-- The notation `[1..]` represents an infinite list of integers: 1, 2, 3, …
-- We've already seen the `map` function, that takes a function and a list
-- and returns the result of applying that function to elements of the list.
--
-- Write a function that generates an infinite list of 1/x² for x = 1, 2, 3,…
-- Call the function `series`. (4) below should now be correct

series = map oneOverXSquared [1..] 

-------
-- 5 --
-------

-- The `take` built-in function returns the first `n` elements of a collection:
--
--      take 5 [1..]    => [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
--
-- The `sum` function returns the sum of a collection
--
--      sum [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]   => 15
--      (could also have written: sum [1..5])
--
--  Write a function `sumOfFirst` that takes a number and a (possibily infinite)
--  list of numbers and returns the sum of the first n elements
--
--       sumOfFirst 5 [1..]     => 15
--
--  Uncomment (5) to verify

sumOfFirst n x = sum (take n x)

-- This is just for fun. I've supplied the function `eulerSum`
-- which uses the code you've written above to calculate 6 times the
-- sum of the first `n` reciprocals of squares, and then returns the square
-- root of that value
--
-- Play with this function in ghci, passing in powers of 10 (1, 10, 100, ...) 
-- as the parameter. What value does it converge to? 

eulerSum n = sqrt $ 6 * sumOfFirst n series

-- It appears to converge on pi!
-- Passing 10000000 gave 3.1415925580959025 which is accurate to 6 decimal places, not too shabby.
